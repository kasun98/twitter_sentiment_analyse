# twitter_sentiment_analyse

This project focuses on sentiment analysis of Twitter data using machine learning models. The goal is to classify tweets into positive, negative, or neutral sentiment categories.

## Models Used
- **Naive Bayes**: A simple probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem with strong independence assumptions between features.
- **Logistic Regression**: A linear model for binary classification that estimates probabilities using the logistic function.
- **Gradient Boosting Classifier**: An ensemble learning technique that builds a strong model by combining multiple weak models in a sequential manner.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluation consists of tweets labeled with sentiment categories. It includes features such as text content, and metadata.

## Evaluation
Each model was trained on a portion of the dataset and evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. 

## Usage
- The code for training and evaluating the models can be found in the notebook.
- Detailed instructions on data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation are provided within the notebook.
- Additionally, pre-trained models and evaluation results are available for reference.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, etc.
